I don't necessarily know that it would be effective for younger students to do that, because they would probably be biased and have immature things to say, but certainly for college professors, it would make it easier for prospective students to know a teacher's bedside manner to understand certain tendencies of the teacher, whether or not they're misogynistic, first say. People would definitely, people like to refer to them more than they do the positive aspects of people. So yeah, it's kind of a joke for teachers. I think it exists and it's a good idea.

A good teacher makes or breaks a class, especially a teacher that you know might be a good personality match for yourself."

For instance, someone who is a talented singer, you know, they just kind of wake up one day and say, I can sing. I can hit ranges high, ranges low, versus someone, you know, who says, OK, well, I can hold a note, but I can't, I don't have range. So I'm going to go to a vocal specialist who's going to train me on how to hit those high notes and those low notes and be just as good or better than the person who is talented. But because I worked hard, I'm just as good as a talented person. So I think they just kind of maybe even go hand in hand. Like if you have the talent to do something, but if you add a little hard work to it, it, you know, makes that talent a bit stronger into a skilled talent. So I say, either hand in hand, tie, and then finish."

So you're going to be self-driving planes next, like, you know, exactly where does it stop? When do we start to do anything, keep doing things for ourselves?
