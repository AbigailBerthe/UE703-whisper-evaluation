While I'm at home, I can literally wake up, go brush my teeth, choose to take a shower, probably want to crank up my computer, work for three, four solid hours, get a workout in, come back home, eat my lunch, and work as much as I want to. Because I don't have to worry about dealing with the traffic, getting home early, or trying to beat traffic because there's an event in town or what not. So I much rather work from home because I'm way more productive than I am. Also, I work for a company that has a lot of money, and can't do anything about it.

You know, at that point, you know, they've made me take in public transportation or exercise a little bit more freedom and walking home or going, you know, to the next lecture for a dinner after school activities. So I think, you know, they're also a little older in terms of being able to keep up and not lose something that's so expensive to my peak. I think, six, six, seven, three. Like 12, two, five, three.

I don't necessarily know that it would be effective for younger students to do that, because they would probably be biased in premature things to say, but certainly for college professors, it would make it easier for prospective students to know a teacher's bedside manner to understand certain tendencies of the teacher, whether or not they're misogynistic, for say, I'm not really... People like to report the negative more than they do the positive aspects of people. So yeah, kind of a yelp for teachers. I think it exists and it's a good idea.
