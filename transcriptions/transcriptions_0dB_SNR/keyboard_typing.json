I live in the United States but I live in the land of Georgia and track a community off. So I can say in the cross-ferred lease an hour a day. I'm just 30 minutes to get into work. Probably 30 to 45 minutes. Sometimes an hour to have to work. You still have things that you have to do during work. I can literally wake up from the wake up, go brush my teeth. Choose to take a shower for. I want to crank up my computer, work for three, four-cell hours. Get a workout in, come back home, eat my lunch. And work as much as I want to because I'm not worried about dealing with the traffic getting home early or trying to beat traffic because there's an offended camera or whatnot. So I'm much rather working home because I'm waiting for the doctor to come back home. I'll put you a welfare account from your laptop and you can go to the police and all of this. If these get, these can get a river to the left or at my home. It's quiet. No way, you also around the amount of carbon complex to working from home. Because I'm going to be asked, I can control the quality of my laptop and I can also touch up the music here. I showed the amount of traffic that I've sent down here. And to, you know, around the bottom of the home, I can actually hear them. And they can hear me and they can hit her back ground most. So I'm much further for a work even more. Thank you.",

You may not know this, but I live in Atlanta, Georgia, and traffic can be awful. So I can stay in the car for at least an hour a day. Just 30 minutes to get into work, probably 30 to 45 minutes, sometimes an hour, have to work. You still have things that you have to do during work. While I'm at home, I can literally wake up, go brush my teeth, choose to take a shower if I want to, crank up my computer, work for three, four solid hours, get a workout in, come back home, eat my lunch, and work as much as I want to because I don't have to worry about dealing with the traffic, getting home early, or trying to beat traffic because there's an event in town or what not. So I much rather work from home because I'm way more productive than at home. Also too, I work for a company in the US, about 100,000 to 20,000 employees in all of this. Things can get riveted around where I'm at home. It's quiet. Nobody else around me, my apartment complex is working from home because I'm the only one there, so I can control the volume. I can also catch up on my DVR shows. I can also catch up on my TACSICs and COM2. And too, you know, when I'm talking to people in my conference call, I can actually hear them and they can hear me and they don't hit their background. So I must prefer rather working from home."

I don't necessarily know that it would be effective for younger students to do that because they would probably be biased in immature things to say, certainly for college professors, it would make it easier for prospective students to know a teacher's bedside manner to understand certain tendencies of the teacher, whether or not they're misogynistic, first and foremost. People would definitely like to report the negative more than they do the positive aspects of people. So yeah, it's kind of a guilt for teachers. I think it exists and it's a good idea. I would definitely go visit a site like that and want to know everything I could about a professor. A good teacher makes a break to class, especially a teacher that you know might be a good personality match for yourself."

I like how easy and user-friendly they are. Honestly, I feel like I've read an article or a book recently about, you know, Apple and the reasoning behind some of their products, and they really wanted to make something for everybody, like a piece of technology that you didn't have to be like, you know, super tech savvy in order to use it. It was kind of the computer for all people and not just, you know, computer savvy people. So I personally like Macs. I like the interface. I like the look of, you know, when you turn it on, it's just super easy to use. And so yeah, I think simply because of the user-friendly nature and the fact that it syncs with all of my devices, my iPhone, iPads, all that kind of stuff, it's kind of just nice to stay in the same brand. So yeah, I'm definitely a Mac person."
