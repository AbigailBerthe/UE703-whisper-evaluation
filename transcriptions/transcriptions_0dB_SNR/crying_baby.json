So you can go to the phone and watch the crank up on computer, work the three, four-cell hours. Get it work out, get it work out, get it come back home, eat mullage. And work as much as I want. I'm going to get a film with the traffic. Oh, getting really work on a piece of plastic because there's nothing. And we're going to... So I'm much rather working on it because I'm way more focused on that. Also two, I love for a company that has about 120, 5 and 40s in all of this. But things can get really, really loud to wear a mat home. It's quite. No way you also know you're not quite working on it. It's smoking from home because I'm only one there. So I'm going to take a look at all of you. I can also catch up on my TV or show. I'm going to take a look at the same time too. And two, yeah, when I'm talking to people who don't want to call, I can actually do it on my hand and you get to know me and me and me. I want to do that kind of noise.

Probably 30 to 45 minutes sometimes an hour after work. You still have things that you have to do during work. So while I'm at home, I can literally wake up, go brush my teeth. She's the type of guy that I want. She crank up my computer, work for three, four solid hours, get a workout in, come back home, eat my lunch, and work as much as I want to because I don't want to get worried about dealing with the traffic. You get home early or kind of do your classes because there's an opinion panel right now. So I much rather work from home because I'm way more productive than at home. Also too, I work for a company that has about 125 employees in the office. Things can get really, really loud. Where I'm at home is quiet. No way else around the apartment complex is working from home because I'm the only one there. So I can control the volume. I can also catch up on my DVR shows, I can multitask for the same time too. And too, you know, when I'm talking to people in the company, it's called, I can actually hear them and they can hear me and they don't hear the background noise. I prefer working from home."
