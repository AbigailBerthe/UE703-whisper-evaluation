I don't necessarily know that it would be effective for younger students to do that because they would probably be biased and have immature things to say. Certainly for college professors, it would make it easier for prospective students to know a teacher's bedside manner to understand certain tendencies of the teacher, whether or not they're misplacing the students. People would definitely like to report that they never know more than to do the problem aspect of people. Yeah, kind of a yelp for teachers, but it just needs to be a good idea. I would definitely go with that more and know everything I could about a professor. A good teacher makes a great success, especially a teacher that you know my opinion for now. That's really nice."

I can hit ranges high, ranges low, versus someone who says, okay, well, I can hold a note, but I don't have range, so I'm going to go to a vocal specialist who's going to train me on how to hit those high notes and those low notes and be just as good or better than the person who is talented. But because I worked hard, I'm just as good as a talented person. So I think they just kind of maybe even go hand in hand. Like if you have the talent to do something, but if you add a little hard work to it, it makes that talent a bit stronger to a skill talent. So I say, either hand in hand, tied in that range."
