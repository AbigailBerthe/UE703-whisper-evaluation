I would definitely go visit a site like that and want to know everything I could about a professor. A good teacher makes or breaks a class, especially a teacher that you know might be a good personality match for yourself."

I can hit ranges high, ranges low, versus someone, you know, who says, OK, well, I can hold a note, but I can't. I can't raise, I can go to the eighth, eighth, eighth and specials, because I'm training on how to hit those high notes and those low notes and be just as good or better than the person who is talented.
