I want to clean up my computer, work three, four solid hours, get a workout, come back home, eat my lunch, and work as much as I want to, because I don't have to worry about dealing with the traffic, getting home early, or trying to keep traffic as well as my family can't go out.

In a book that I read, one of the premises was that the world was becoming flat, which means that we're getting closer, we're so much closer to all the other countries in the world that if you really need to communicate to other countries and do business with other countries, you should learn a language. And do you do learn a language better between one and two? Since you're young, I tell you, you're 12 years old and that's really difficult to learn a different language. So schools should start teaching when they start in kindergarten and they should teach whatever in Spanish and French. The most broken language is because you can only buy them and give them two minutes to learn a student to be in a possession and to use both languages. I'm sure that everyone will really be able to have better options at two-part jobs and lots of students. So yes, definitely schools should really use foreign language better than other countries."
