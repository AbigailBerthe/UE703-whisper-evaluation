Also to we had lunch room ladies I don't think we would definitely chefs on birthday. You don't have to have nutritionists in the chef to actually put those lunches together and that's going to cost money by school systems. You know, that's enough. Don't have. So to me it's a lost class. I remember what I ate in elementary school and in elementary school and in square pizza, soccer, and so on. I wasn't able to help you in the middle so didn't taste that quickly either. So it's definitely a lost class. In a way I only think that would have to tell a parent seat if I was going to take a kiss to have a healthier lunch. It's debris dead. But then again a lot of kids are going to be able to afford to go to the wrong temperature day that the family free lunch programs to schools have. And again that's why I say some of us cars because how are these holes going to be able to afford healthy lunch from the can barely afford to pay the teachers.",
                "small": " Do you think a healthier school lunch program is a lost cause? I personally think a healthier school lunch program is a lost cause because right now school is not like when I was there. It was actually properly funded on state, federally and locally. But now it just seems like schools are not properly funded. So to me, how are they going to afford healthier ingredients to make those foods? Also too, we had lunchroom ladies. I don't think they were technically chefs. Per se, you're going to have to have nutritionists and a chef to actually put those lunches together. And that's going to cost money that school systems, you know, as you know, don't have. So to me, it's a lost cause. I remember what I ate in elementary school, middle school, and square pizzas, taco salad. It wasn't the healthiest and I also didn't taste that good either. So it's definitely a lost cause. In a way, the only thing I would have to tell the parents and advice them if they want their kids to have a healthier lunch is to break it. But then again, a lot of kids aren't going to be able to afford to do lunch every day. They depend on free lunch programs that schools have. And again, that's why I say it's a lost cause because how are these schools going to be able to afford a healthy lunch when they can barely afford to pay their teachers?"

And sugar is actually quite addictive. It's probably has a problem with a lot of health in our country. But we're meant to eat that much sugar. Honestly, like in nature, it's a lot harder to find sugar. Especially processed sugar just doesn't exist. You can mostly get it through fruits and stuff. So yeah, that is a big problem with fast food and junk food in general. And the companies are doing that because they know it's addictive. They know people like more sugar in their food. And that it's hard to turn it down once they start getting it. And so they sell more product. But at the expense of hurting their customers. But I guess they don't care. I think natural foods would probably be better with less processed sugars and processed in general. But that is the way it is with a lot of what people eat today."

In a book that I read, one of the premises was that the world was becoming flat, which means that we're getting closer, we're so much closer to all the other countries in the world that if you really need to communicate to other countries and do business with other countries, you should learn another language. And do you do your language better between one since you're young, I'm sure you're 12 years old and it's really difficult to absorb a different language. So schools should start teaching when they start in kindergarten and they should teach whatever, you know, Spanish and French. The most spoken language is because I can only buy them and give opportunities to that student to be in a position where he can use both languages and he can actually earn more money and he can have better options as to what job he wants to choose. So yes, definitely schools should really enforce learning that second language."
