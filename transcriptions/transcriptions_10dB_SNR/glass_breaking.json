What's happening is you have a lot of illnesses, students have solely revolving around their depression and difficulty with coping. I think it would be silly to completely just manage sports programs from school. But I do think that there needs to be a significant major shift from solely sports into more wellness programs.

In a book that I read, one of the premises was that the world was becoming flat, which means that we're getting closer, we're so much closer to all the other countries in the world that if you really need to communicate to other countries and do business with other countries, you should learn another language. And do you do learn a language better between one since you're young until you're 12 years old and then it's really difficult to absorb a different language? So schools should start teaching when they start in kindergarten and they should teach whatever, you know, Spanish and French. The most spoken language is because I can only buy them and give opportunities to that student to be in a position where he can use both languages and he can actually earn more money and he can have better options as to what job he wants to choose. So yes, definitely schools should really enforce learning that type of language."

For instance, someone who is a talented singer, they just kind of wake up one day and say, I can sing. I can hit ranges high, ranges low, versus someone who says, okay, well, I can hold a note, but I don't have range, so I'm going to go to a vocal specialist who's going to train me on how to hit those high notes and those low notes and be just as good or better than the person who is talented. But because I worked hard, I'm just as good as a talented person. So I think they just kind of maybe even go hand in hand. Like if you have the talent to do something, but if you add a little hard work to it, it makes that talent a bit stronger into a skill talent. So I say, either hand in hand, tied in that range."
