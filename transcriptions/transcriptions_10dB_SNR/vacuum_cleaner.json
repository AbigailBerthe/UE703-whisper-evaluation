So they need to understand, like a tough love, maybe see some footage of what happens when you get a DUI and each time what it means. Losing that license, losing a lot of freedom, there's always Uber or parents could pick kids up, they certainly wouldn't want the kids to do that, but if need be, kids have to just be very aware and the parents have to keep talking about it here and there, not to mad them, but just to keep reminding them and instill it in their heads."
