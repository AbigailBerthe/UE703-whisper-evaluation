Watching rich people gives us that closeness of thinking like, oh man, first of all, we're witnessing the richness, the quality of life, and then on the second part it's like, I gotta have that or I will once have that. Or look at how he or she is living, look at what they do to achieve this. So I'm gonna follow what this person does, cause I can get it too. But a lot of it doesn't show, like it's just, a lot of it is imaging, a lot of it is meant to like visually seduce us, but we don't know the true cost of a lot of these things. We do not know like the depths of each person's story of how they became this rich person with all this luxury with everybody, you know, basically like looking up to them. That's a lot of pressure, it's a lot of stuff, but we love it cause it's so easy to fall in love with."

Because I just don't agree with how some people think that relationships have to be one way because we're not one way. That's just how I feel."

I personally think a healthier school runs program is definitely a loss cause because right now it's schools not like when I was there it was actually properly funded state federally and locally but now it just seems like schools not properly funded so I think how are they going to afford healthier programs to make their best for it? Also too we had long-term ladies I don't think they were technically chefs on Versailles you have to have nutritionism a chef actually put those lunches together and that's going to cost money but the school systems you know as you know don't have So to me it's a lost college I remember what I ate and elementary school school and square pizza, taco salad. It wasn't the healthiest and also didn't taste that great either so it's definitely a loss cause. In a way I only think that would have to tell a parent so if I assume they want their kids to have a healthier lunch it's to break it. But then again a lot of kids are not going to be able to afford to bring their lunch every day if they're in a free lunch program and schools have and again that's why it saves a lot of the cost because how are these schools going to be able to afford healthy lunch from the can barely afford to pay the teachers.",

I personally think a healthier school lunch program is definitely a lost cause because right now school is not like when I was there. It was actually properly funded state, federally and locally. But now it just seems like schools are not properly funded. So to me, how are they going to afford healthier ingredients to make those foods? Also too, we had lunchroom ladies, I don't think they were technically chefs. Per se, you're going to have to have nutritionists and a chef to actually put those lunches together. And that's going to cost money that school systems, as you know, don't have. So to me, it's a lost cause. I remember what I ate in elementary school and middle school and square pizzas, taco salad. It wasn't the healthiest and I also didn't taste that great either. So it's definitely a lost cause. In a way, the only thing I would have to tell the parents at Boston if they want their kids to have a healthier lunch is to bring good. But then again, a lot of kids aren't going to be able to afford to bring their lunch every day, the problem that depending on the free lunch programs that schools have.
