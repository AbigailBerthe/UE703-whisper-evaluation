You may not know this but I live in Atlanta, Georgia and traffic can be awful. So I can stay in the car for at least an hour a day, just 30 minutes to get into work, probably 30 to 45 minutes, sometimes an hour after work. You still have things that you have to do during work. While I'm at home I can literally wake up, go brush my teeth, choose to take a shower if I want to, crank up my computer, work for three, four solid hours, get a workout in, come back home, eat my lunch, and work as much as I want to because I don't have to worry about dealing with the traffic of getting home early or trying to beat traffic because there's an event in town or what not. So I much rather work from home because I'm way more productive when I'm at home. Also too, I work for a company that has about 125 employees in the office. Things can get really, really loud.

Certainly for college professors, it would make it easier for prospective students to know a teacher's bedside manner to understand certain tendencies of the teacher, whether or not they're misogynistic, first and foremost. People would definitely like to report the negative more than they do the positive aspects of people. So yeah, kind of a yelp for teachers. I think it exists and it's a good idea. I would definitely go visit a site like that and want to know everything I could about a professor. A good teacher makes or breaks a class, especially a teacher that you know might be a good personality match for yourself."

You have also to have a great music, like a soundtrack that, you know, not something very complicated, but just a few good notes, something that basically stays in the audience's head once they're done watching this commercial. Also a good product could help, though we have many examples of crappy products that are being sold through excellent commercials. So I really think that at the end of the day, it's the energy that comes from the bassline, the music. Someone also who is pleasant to look at would also help. But in the end, it's really like the atmosphere you create and the sense of comfort, the sense of happiness that you bring while not being too pushy. I love commercials that are actually suggesting things rather than just being too much in your face."

I come to a time in my life where I have some problems from my time in the war that create problems for me when I'm dealing with an environment that say could be, have stress factors that are not within my control. It gets very difficult for me to handle those. So if I had the ability to work from home, I could still do the productive things that I have in my life, the things I know that I'm good at and be able to share those. But now that I have, you know, some things that, you know, undermine that ability, it definitely gets me to a point where I would feel so much more comfortable working at home. And I believe that companies need to provide more of those because I think there's a lot of things that people like me could do from home to benefit them without having to, you know, have people show up in the office."
