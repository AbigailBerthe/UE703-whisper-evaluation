You know, this is a difficult question because it really has to do with civil liberties or your own pursuit of how you want to live your life. And there's a balance with that of how much government has to take care of you if you don't do the right things. So the idea to take in cigarette smoking and sugar, the idea is it okay to smoke if we know you're going to end up in a hospital and somebody else is going to have to pay for your care. And I think sugary drinks, believe it or not, fall into that. And I think there's enough study out there to say that sugary drinks lead to obesity. Obviously in moderation, maybe it's not. But the idea is, yeah, there are guidelines, at least maybe regulated. You know, there is the Food and Drug Act that says you have to put the amount on each one. And then so I think it would be hard for the government to regulate that other than that."
